It’s a Python based game in which the user assumes the role of the player and attempts to survive a zombie apocalypse. The game begins at the player’s office where he’s informed about the fierce onslaught of zombies in the local area. In such deadly conditions the player must escape and reach the underground shelter or else be devoured by the savage brain-deads. But, safety doesn’t come easy in a situation like this. Through this journey, the player encounters many levels accompanied by different challenges.
